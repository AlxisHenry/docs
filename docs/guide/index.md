# Welcome ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Alexis, <strong>junior developer</strong> from Strasbourg, France :fr:.

I'm a versatile software developer with a passion for exploring new programming languages and technologies. I believe that it is essential to have a broad understanding of different programming paradigms and practices in order to create effective solutions to complex problems.

I am always eager to learn and improve my skills. My goal is to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in the tech industry, and to continuously expand my knowledge and capabilities.

So if you're looking for a developer who is not afraid to take on new challenges and explore uncharted territory, look no further!
