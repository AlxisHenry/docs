## Github

This project is open-source and available on a Github repository, accessible [here](https://github.com/AlxisHenry/slides).

## Presentation

This project is made with HTML, CSS and javascript. He's based on [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/), a javascript HTML Presentation Framework. I create an interface, in [php](https://www.php.net/), to see more easily the availables slides.

Some slides are already in the github repository : theses slides are related to differents presentations that I had to make. 

If you want to setup in local the application, you juste need to follow the readme's instructions in the [github repository](https://github.com/AlxisHenry/slides).
